# Muse2 :musical_note:

### Muse2 :musical_note: is a React web application that serves as a place for users to create and listen to playlists of songs/music videos/podcasts - any multimedia files. Currently serving Youtube videos, it was born from the desire to make an audio/video player that could be fine-tuned and accommodate links from across the platforms.

#### It has the ability to: 
- Create playlists :heavy_plus_sign:
- Delete playlists :heavy_minus_sign:
- Add songs/music videos to the playlists :heavy_plus_sign:
- Delete songs :heavy_minus_sign: 
- Autoplay playlists (desktop) :play_or_pause_button:
- Randomize songs within playlists :8ball:
- Drag and droppable songs through React-beautiful-dnd :pinching_hand:
- Saving through LocalStorage :wrench:
- More! :point_down:


#### Upcoming features I want to implement:
- Login/Signup rather than current LocalStorage system.... :clipboard:
- Zoom out mode for drag and droppable playlists :pinching_hand:
- Add tags to songs :hash:
- Search by song title, playlist title, or tag :telescope:
- Special animation/styling/mobile :sparkles:
- Integrate Spotify, podcasts, etc... :notes:
- Share playlists between users :outbox_tray:
- More! :heavy_plus_sign:

I've been working on this project since the beginning of the summer, and enjoy the incredible nuance React has lended me! :+1:
